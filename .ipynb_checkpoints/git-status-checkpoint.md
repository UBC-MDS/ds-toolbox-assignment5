# Definition: git status

The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. 
It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. 
Status output does not show you any information regarding the committed project history.

Usage: git status
The git status command is a relatively straightforward command. 
It simply shows you what's been going on with git add and git commit. 
Status messages also include relevant instructions for staging/unstaging files.

If using the JupyterLab IDE, go to git on the left panel, you can see the staged, changed, untracked files under the changes tab.
