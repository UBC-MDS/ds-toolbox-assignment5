Defintion: git status
git status is a command that shows the working tree status. 
It will display:
1. differences between working files and the HEAD commit
2. paths that have differences between the working tree and the working files
3. paths in the working tree that are not tracked by Git

The functionality of git status can be accessed directly in Jupyter Lab through the Git sidebar.
