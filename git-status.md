# Definition: git status
The *git status* command is used to display the state of the repository and staging area. After running this command, the output will show *branch information, staging area status, and untracked files*:
When there are no changes or commits, the output will be showning **The current branch; and nothing to commit, working tree clean**.
When there are changes or commits, the output will be showning **The current branch; list of changes made but not staged for commit, and list of untracked files. At last, provide instruction saying no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit")**.

To access *git status* in JupyterLab IDE, use either **Git Extension** (shown on the leftside bar with staged files and untracked files) or **Command Palette** (under **View** type *Git:Status*).
