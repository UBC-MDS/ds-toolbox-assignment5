### Definition: git status

The *git status* command is used to display the current state of the working directory and the staging area in a Git repository. It shows which files have been modified, added, or deleted, and which changes are staged for the next commit.

The *git status* command is useful for several reasons. It helps you keep track of changes to your project, identify which files need to be staged or committed, and troubleshoot any issues that may arise during the development process. It is also a helpful tool for collaborating with others on a project, as it allows you to see which changes have been made by other team members.

If you were using **JupyterLab IDE** instead of the terminal, you can access the same information provided by the git status command by using the Git extension provided by JupyterLab. The Git extension provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to view the same information as the git status command, along with additional features such as visual diffs and commit history. 

You can access the Git extension by clicking on the Git icon in the left sidebar of JupyterLab.
