In my own words, I would define git status as a Terminal command which allows to see me a list of untracked, changed, and staged files in my branch/repository. This command will also provide useful hints to help me manage my files and commits, such as "(use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)," which means that I should, for example, type git add git-status.md to add this file to my staging area.

I can see the same information in a graphical interface by clicking on the "Git" button in the left-hand side menu of Jupyter Lab. This interface also allows me to do the same operations at the click of a button instead of writing code.
