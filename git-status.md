# Definition: Git Status

Git status shows us the working status of the working tree status
This means that it will show you the status of the repo that you are currently working on

We can access the same information without the terminal through the use of the Jupyter Lab IDE
We can do this through looking at the history tab, which pops up under the git dropdown that is presented on the far left of the Jupyter Lab IDE
