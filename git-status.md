# Definition: git status

The "git status" command is a very useful tool that allows the user to see what differences exist between their local working version of a repository and the remote storage. This makes it easy to determine what updates may have been made to the remote repository (say by a collaborator or the merge of an alternate branch) or where changes have been made on the local working branch that should be made available to collaborators or other branches.

This information can also be obtained from the "changes" section of the jupyter lab IDE, rather than using the terminal.
