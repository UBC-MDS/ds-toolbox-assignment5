# Definition: git status

The *'git status'* command is a Git command used to check the current status of the repository. When you run this command, Git will show you which files have been modified, which files are staged for the next commit, and which files are not being tracked by Git.

This command is useful because it helps you keep track of changes you have made to your repository and lets you know which files are ready to be committed to the repository. It also helps you identify any files that you may have forgotten to add to Git.

If you are using JupyterLab IDE instead of the terminal, you can access the same information provided by the *'git status'* command by opening the Git extension in the left sidebar. The Git extension will show you the same information as the *'git status'* command, including which files have been modified, which files are staged for the next commit, and which files are not being tracked by Git.
