## Definition: git status

With this command we can find out which files have been changed and which 
files are not committed or still are in stage (untracked file and added 
files waiting to be committed)

#In Jupyter IDE:

If you hover over the name of the changed file, youâ€™ll see the icons to: 
open the file; view the diff between the current branch and your change; 
revert the changes, and stage the change.
