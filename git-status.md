The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. 
It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.
To access the same information using JupyterLab IDE, click Jupyter Git extension icon. on the left side, under Changes section, you can see the same info as you would get using git status command.
