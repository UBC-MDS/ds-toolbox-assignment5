Definition: git status
To check if there is .git in the folder or not
Shows the current state of your Git working directory and staging area
Where HEAD is pointing, whether that is a branch or a commit (this is where you are "checked out" to)
If you have any changed files in your current directory that have not yet been committed
If changed files are staged or not
If your current local branch is linked to a remote branch, then git status will tell you if your local branch is behind or ahead by any commits
On JupyterLab IDE, the git icon and the left shows the "Current Repository", "Current Branch", and in "Changes" tab, we can see "Staged", "Changed", and "Untracked"
