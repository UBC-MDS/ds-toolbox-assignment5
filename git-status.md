Definition: git status
This is a bash terminal command, useful for checking the status of all files in the repository you are currently working in. This command can tell you whether any changes are not yet committed (saved). If the repository you are working in is linked to a remote repository, git status will tell you whether the local repository is ahead/ behind the linked remote repository. It is a good practice to use git status to check whether changes made have been committed, and whether you need to push/ pull changes to/from remote repository
Alternatively, through JupyterLab IDE, the side panel serves the function of the git status command. You can see which changes have been made, whether these changes have been committed. The side panel will also show you whether your repository is ahead/ behind the commits on a linked remote repository
