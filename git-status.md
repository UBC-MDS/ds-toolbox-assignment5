"Definition: Git Status"

The git status command is useful for determining the status of the local repository being used. 
The information returned from using the command tells the user which changes have been staged (or not), if they have changes that haven't been committed yet, and untracked files.
To access this informatin using Jupyter IDE navigate to the git tab on the left-hand menu. There you will see dropdown sections for files that have been changed, staged or untracked.
