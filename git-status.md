Definition: git status
The git status is to display:
1. name of the current branches you are on and the up to date branch. 
2. Your status of current repository. 
3. Any file changes based on different status such as staged, changed, untracked, etc.
4. what needs to be commit. 


By clicking the "git" button on the left tool bar from Jupyterlab IDE, we will also get same information as we run "git status" command from terminal.
