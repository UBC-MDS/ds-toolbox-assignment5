Definition: git status

### Command-line Interface (CLI)

The command, ***git status***, indicates the current status of any changes that can be applied to the repository.  It assists the developer to indicate:

1. files that are currently untracked that can be staged and committed
2. files that are tracked that have changes that can be committed
3. if branches are behind the remote repository that require a pull
4. if everything is up to date

### Jupyter IDE

To find the same information as the _git status_ CLI command in the Jupyter IDE, do the following:

1. Click on the git icon on the left hand side
2. Click on the **Changes** button
3. Click on the category in which you are interested: _Staged_, _Changed_ or _Untracked_

You are now ready to stage and commit your changes, revert changes if you've updated a file you didn't want to change or even do nothing if you don't want to submit your untracked files to the repository.
