Definision:git status
When using git status scommand we can get information regarding the hanges that are not staged for commit, changes that are staged for commit, 
untracked files in our working directory and the branch we are currently on.
This command is good becasue it can show us the state of our repository and help understand what changes have been made. 
It's a useful command to run before committing changes to ensure we are committing what we want.
In JupyterLab IDE we can access the same info using th Git extension.
