Definition:git status
The command git status is used to check the status of all files in my repository using the terminal. One advantage of using this git status command is to see the information on which commands to use to continue your workflow.
If using the JupyterLab IDE, I would have access to the side panel that shows which files are Untracked, Changed, and Staged.
