# Definition: git status

The `git status` command is a tool in the Git version control system. It provides  information about the current state of a repository. When you execute this command, it displays the status of the working directory and the staging area. 

`git status` helps you to:
1. Identify files that have been modified, added, or deleted since the last commit.
2. Determine which changes have been staged for the next commit and which have not.
3. See if there are any files that are being tracked by Git but have not been added to the staging area.
4. Check the current branch and whether it is ahead, behind, or diverged from the associated remote branch.

This command is particularly useful for keeping track of changes before committing them to the repository, ensuring that only intended files and modifications are included in a commit.

If you were using the JupyterLab IDE instead of the terminal, you can access similar information provided by the `git status` command through its integrated Git extension. This extension visually represents the repository's status, showing modified, staged, and untracked files, along with the current branch information. It offers an intuitive graphical interface, making it easier for those who prefer not to use command-line tools.
