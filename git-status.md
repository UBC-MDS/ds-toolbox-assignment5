## Usefulness

*git status* is a terminal command that is useful for viewing your working directory and staging area so you can check what files aren't being tracked, as well as what changes you have or haven't staged. Using this command before pushing your changes could save you from having file conflicts or forgetting to add files altogether.

## Jupyter Lab IDE

If you want to see the same information in Jupyter Lab, go to the *Changes* tab and view the sections for *Staged*, *Changed*, and *Untracked*. If there are conflicts, you'll see a *Conflicted* section as well.
