# Definition: git status

**git status** is a useful terminal command. When using this command, the status of the working directory and staging areas are presented in the terminal. Git status shows the state of any changes made within a repository, so you can see if any changes are staged or not. It also outputs if there are any files that are not being tracked by Git.    

The information provided by git status can also be accessed via the changes tab in the JupyterLab IDE.
