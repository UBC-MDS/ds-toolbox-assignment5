### Definition: git status

git status is a command used in the terminal to show the path that are different from the index file. This includes the untracked changes and the stage changes. This function identifies the files prior to being fully commited. 

This is a useful function because you are able to see your working board of file changes prior to your commits and what still needs to be completed prior to pushing out the updated commits. 

Using the jupyter lab IDE instead of using git status you can use the GIT icon located on the left side panel. This tab will show you the current repository, branch, changes (staged or untracked as well). Under this tab you can also view the history which you would have to use git log under the terminal.
