Definition: git status

The git status command is used to determine the state of the code in the working directory, and whether new changes have been made to any of the files in the local repository, whether the changes have been staged or committed to the repository.

If using the JupyterLab IDE instead of the terminal, one can assess git status by clicking on the git icon on the left and seeing whether any files appear in the staged, changed and untracked tabs.
