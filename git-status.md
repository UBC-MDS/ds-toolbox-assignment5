Definition: git status

The `git status` command serves a crucial role in Git, allowing for the examination and presentation of the current state of the working directory and staging area. By executing this command, developers gain insights into untracked files, staged changes ready for commit, and modifications in the working directory yet to be staged. This command provides a real-time, intuitive view, facilitating effective management of file changes. In the JupyterLab IDE, a similar understanding can be achieved through either the graphical user interface or the terminal by utilizing the `git status` command, offering convenient tools for our development process.
