Git status command is used to show: 
1. which branch you are on
2. track status of your files in the repo, specifically: if they are tracked/not tracked, changed/not changed, staged/not staged. comitted/not committed. 
If you are in Jupyter lab IDE the same info can be accessed through the third icon on left side panel (git extension icon). It shows on top the repo/branch you are in, then under the Changes tab, the statuses of your files in this branch/repo.
