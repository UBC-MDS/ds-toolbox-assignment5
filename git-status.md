Definition: git status
In my own word, when you run the git status command, it shows you the current state of your staging and working area. Ex. where the head is at, any pending changes that have not committed, if there's a merge conflicts between remote and source environemnt, if the remote/source environment is behind one or the other. It's a useful command that gives at a glance.
