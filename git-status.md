# Definition: git status

The ***git status*** command shows you information about your current working directory. 

Running the command will show you whether the directory is up-to-date, or if there are changes that have been made but not tracked, staged, or committed. 

Clicking on the Git icon in Jupyter IDE will show you if there are changes that are staged, changed, or untracked. This is similar to what you will see with the git status command in the terminal.
