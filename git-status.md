Definition: git status

Git Status is helpful for giving a breakdown of the 'Changes' tab in my local repository. I can see which of my files are untracked, changed and staged. I can also see which branch my files are pointing to.

If I'm using the JupyterLab IDE, I can use Git Status by opening a new launcher and starting a new terminal session directly in Jupyter Lab.
