Definition: git status
The git status command is useful to keep track of your project and verison control of the project files. 
In the terminal, git status reports on:
  - the number of changes that have been staged or committed
  - the status of any commits on all branches
  - any differences in the local and remote repos.

In the Jupyter IDE the same status information is displayed visual in the git side panel.
The side panel lists the following for each branch:
  - remote changes
  - staged 
  - changed
