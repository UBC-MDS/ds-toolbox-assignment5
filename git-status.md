# Definition: git status #

__git status__ is a terminal command that lets you know the current status of the files in your current branch. Files may be Staged, Changed, or Untracked. Untracked files are non-relevant files/internal files for the program. Changed files are files you have worked on in your local repository. Staged files are files you have added (git add file_name) staging area to commit and push to github. 

In the JupyterLab IDE __git status__ can be checked by clinking on the git button (far left) then the changes tab (left, lower). Staged, Changed, and Untracked files can then all be seen in there respective arrow-down tabs.
