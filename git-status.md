### **Definiton: git-status** 
 
git status shows the current status of your repo. 
It will show you if you have any work that is unstaged, 
what branch you are on, how many commits you are ahead of the master remote on github, and other useful things.

To access the same information in Jupyter IDE instead of terminal we can:
1. Open JupyterLab.
2. Click on the "Git" tab in the left sidebar.
3. In the Git tab, we'll see a list of all the files in your repository.
4. Click on a file to see the changes that have been made to it.
5. To commit changes, we can use the "Commit" button in the Git tab which will open a dialog box where you can enter a commit message and commit the changes.
6. To push changes to the remote repository, you can use the "Push" button in the Git tab.
