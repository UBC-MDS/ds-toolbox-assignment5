Definition: git status
git-status command shows the state of the repository and staging area. We can see which changes we have already commited and which have not. It includes information on the files that are not tracked.
It is especially helpful when we don't know which files are staged, unstaged, and untracked. 
In terminal we can simply type "git status";
When using JupyterLab IDE we can access the same information in git tab under Changes.
