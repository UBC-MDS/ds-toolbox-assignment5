#Definition: git status

The git status command in the terminal is used to show the status of the files in the current directory as well as the staging area. It helps the user to see what changes are in the staging area, which aren't, as well as those that are untracked by Git.

To access the same information provided by this command in JupyterLab IDE, navigate to the side panel of under Git and "Changes" tab. This shows the changes that are staged, changed, and untracked.
