Definition: git status
git status is a command in bash terminal. git status returns the status of all files within your current repository. It can let you know whether there are any changes that have yet to be committed, and also how your local repository compares with a linked remote repository (if there is one). Specifically, git status will return whether your local repository is ahead/behind the remote repository by any number of commits. If you were to use the Jupyter Lab IDE, the Git sidebar provides the information that git status would - you can see which changes have been made, status of these changes (staged/ committed), and whether you need to push/ pull any changes between local and remote repositories.
