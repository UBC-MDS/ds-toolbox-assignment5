# Definition: git status

The command 'git-status' provides information on the status of the files in the local repository.

Here are some of the examples of what type of information you can get:

* where HEAD is pointing
* if there are any changed files in the current directory that are not yet committed
* if any of the changed files have not been staged yet

## Terminal option

Simply type 'git status' in the terminal window. Make sure you are in the local repository working directory.

## Jupyter Lab

Similar information to what 'git status' provides could be accessed in the Jupyter Lab by checking the Changes tab in Git tab of the side panel IDE. 

## Comparison

Using Terminal option has certain advantages over Jupyter Lab option as it gives you useful commands to continue your workflow.
