Definition: git status

The `git status` command allows you to: 
- Check the current status of your repository. 
- Provides information about the state of your working directory, including any changes you have made, files that are staged for commit, and files that are untracked.

`git status` in JupyterLab IDE:

1. In JupyterLab, click on the Git tab in the left sidebar. 

2. The current branch you're on is displayed at the top of the Git extension panel.

3. The Git extension panel shows a list of modified files that are staged for commit. You can review the changes by clicking on the file names.

4. The Git extension panel also provides a list of untracked files in your working directory. These files will be listed separately, and you can click on them to see their contents.

5. The Git extension panel displays the commit history, including the commit messages, authors, and timestamps. You can scroll through the list to review the commits.
