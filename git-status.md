Definition: git-status

The git status command allows you to check the status of your repository and wether or not there have been changes in your local files that need to be staged, commited, or pushed. Alternatively, it also provides you information about the remote repository and if there are changes that need to be pulled. Within the IDE of jupyter lab, if you press on the git tab on the lefthand side of the interface, it opens a space where there is information around what has been changed, what has been staged. Furthermore, if there are elements to be pushed or pulled from the remote repository, there is a small orange dot on the respective buttons found on the top of the open tab.
