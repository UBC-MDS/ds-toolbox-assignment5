# Definition: git status

Specifically, explain what the git status command is useful for. How can you access the same information provided by this command if you were using the JupyterLab IDE instead of the terminal?

The **git status** command is useful for:
- checking the status of all files in your repository
- checking the staging area before each commit to ensure you are committing what you think you are
- detecting which files are affected in the merge conflict

If you were using the JupyterLab IDE instead of the terminal, you can access the same information under the Jupyter Git extension tab under "Changes".
