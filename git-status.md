Definition: git status
git status is a command that can tell you about the status of tracked or untracked changes, if they are staged or unstaged, that you have made in Git since the last commit. It's useful for seeing if files have been changed.

It is possible to see the same information if you navigate to the repository of interest in Jupyter IDE and click on changes. It will show you staged, changed and untracked changes.
