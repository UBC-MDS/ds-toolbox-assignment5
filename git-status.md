"Definition: git status" 
The command "git status" is useful to know in real time the status of changes that are saved, committed or tracked within the working directory or repository.
How can you access the same information provided by this command if you were using the JupyterLab IDE instead of the terminal?
If we are working in the Jupyter Lab IDE, the status of the files i.e (Untracked / Changed / Staged) can be conveniently accessed using the Gitlab extension the Jupyter Lab.
