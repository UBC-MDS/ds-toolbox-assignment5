## Definition: git status <br>

Using 'git status' in the terminal brings up the following information: <br>
* which branch of the repository we are currently on (state of the current working directory)
* untracked files that have yet to be added/committed
* if we are working with a remote repository, any differences between the local repository and remote repository will be listed
* if we were working in a Jupyter Lab IDE as opposed to a terminal, clicking on the git button on the left, and then on 'Changes' would show any files yet to be committed under 'Untracked', and any changes that have been committed but not yet pushed to the remote repository would be listed under 'Staged'
* if there were changes in the remote repository that have not yet been pulled to the local repo, the little cloud icon top left would have a notification dot next to it.
* if there were change in the local repo that have not yet been pushed to the local repo, then the little cloud icon top right would have a notifications dot next to it.
