# Definition: git status

The `git status` command is used in Git to show the current state of your repository. When you run `git status`, Git provides information about the files and branches in your repository and indicates any modifications, additions, or deletions that have occurred.

In the JupyterLab IDE, this information can be found on the Git panel (assuming the extenstion is installed), mostly on the **Changes** subpanel, where any modifications, additions, or deletions are shown. Additionally, the name of the currently checked out branch is always displayed at the top of the Git panel.
